# arduino-uno-automatic-door-opening-system
The project concerns about automatic door opening and closing system. An automatic door control system includes a sensor for sensing person or object approaching door. Systems and methods are very common in the art for opening and closing doors to enter and exit buildings, facilities etc. Automatic doors are commonly found in retail stores, supermarkets, and the like.  The project generally relates to an automatic opening and closing of door which will sense person or object approaching door and open automatically. This system is controlled by Arduino micro controller. The system includes DC motor which makes door to slides during opening or closing by rack and pinion gearing, a LCD to display information state of door, an audio buzzer to make sound through the duration of opened door and a controller for controlling the opening and closing of the door as a person or object detected by sensor.
